An LLM, ChatGPT-4.5 (OpenAI), was used solely during the analytical phase to assist with R troubleshooting (identifying and correcting coding errors, debugging scripts, clarifying error messages, and annotating sections of the pipeline script for ease of reading). The LLM was not used for study design, hypothesis generation, interpretation of results, statistical decision-making, or substantive manuscript drafting. No AI-generated images were used in this study; all visualizations were derived from code and source data. No participant-level or sensitive data were shared with the LLM; all the interactions were limited to de-identified code snippets and error text. All LLM suggestions were independently reviewed and verified by the authors and incorporated only when reproduced in version-controlled scripts.
